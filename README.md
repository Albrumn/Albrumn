## About Me

### Web Developer

🎓 In college, I studied game design/development with technologies like Unity, Unreal, and GameMaker.

👨‍💼 Nowadays, I am a professional web developer, working on responsive, dynamic websites.

🎮 From time to time, I'll even work on a web-based game!

### Language Learner 🇩🇪 🇯🇵 🇻🇦 🇪🇸

🗣 Aside from German, which I use to chat with relatives, learning foreign languages is one of my favorite hobbies.

📙 I am currently working my way through "Lingua Latina per se Illustrata: Pars I" and taking a look at a few of the German books by Olly Richards every now and then.

📱 I'm learning Japanese with Duolingo and practicing German with Lingo Legend.
